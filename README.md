## About

Exercise in Scala to implement some basic things related to BitTorrent protocol.

Idea came from looking at the 'Build your own BitTorrent' exercise at CodeCrafters.io.

The project uses 'scala-cli', so that needs to be installed.
Also using [just](https://just.systems/) as command runner.

Compiling:
```shell
just build
```

Run:
```shell
just run --help
```

Tests:
```shell
just test
```
